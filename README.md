### Why We Chose Thailand
Vality's decision to develop its fintech startup in Thailand is based on several factors, including the growing market of tech-savvy consumers, the supportive government policies, the low cost
of living, the strong infrastructure, and the strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia.
The large and growing market of tech-savvy consumers offers a significant opportunity for fintech startups to tap into this growing demand and offer innovative solutions that meet the
needs of Thai consumers.
The establishment of regulatory sandboxes and tax incentives for fintech startups are examples of the supportive government policies. Thailand's low operating costs and strategic location provide opportunities to grow beyond the domestic market and tap into the huge potential of the wider region.
